Darkroot  {#darkroot}
=====================

There are some parts of the `kindlebt` codebase that will remain
undocumented. These parts mainly have to do with existing data structures
used by the underlying Bluetooth library.

When developing, or debugging `kindlebt`, you might need to reference some of
these undocumented parts. For this, you should go through the **Building
kindlebt** section of the previous [Building][] document. Running
`meson setup` is paramount to this.

Once you have done so, subprojects will be set up, and then you can find
relevant documentation in the `darkroot` subproject. For instance, using
`ripgrep` to search for a specific enumerator:

```sh
rg --color=always -C3 -i 'STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY' subprojects/darkroot
```
